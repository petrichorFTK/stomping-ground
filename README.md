Stomping Ground - a personal lab that I will expand upon to meet my exploratory needs!

This is my lab. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My lab is my best friend. It is my life. I must grow it as I must grow my professional life.
Without me, my lab is useless. Without my lab, I am useless.
Wait what?? That's not true not at all.

This setup will get you 51.7% of the way through the Defensive [Origins/APT06202001](https://github.com/DefensiveOrigins/APT06202001) setup for the "Applied Purple Teaming" class. There is still some manual setup that needs to take place but it gets you all the boxes with the necessary downloads on them. I will write a step-by-step guide on how to finish the 49.7% that's left soon.

In order to use this Vagrantfile you must have downloaded and installed [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) from HashiCorp. Once you run:
> vagrant init
a default Vagrantfile will be placed in the directory replace it with this one and run:
> vagrant validate
just to be sure followed by:
> vagrant up
